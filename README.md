# Week 1 Code Challenge

This repository contains three JavaScript files that perform calculations for real-life Kenyan use cases: making chai, estimating boda boda fare, and calculating mobile money transaction fees. Each script uses Node.js with `readline` for user input and demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and conditional logic.
